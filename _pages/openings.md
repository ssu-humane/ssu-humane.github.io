# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

## Postdocs
We currently don't have an open position for postdocs, but please feel free to reach me for potential future openings or collaboration opportunities.

## Graduate students
If you are interested in pursuing a master’s or doctoral degree with me at Soongsil Univ., please send me (kunwoo dot park at ssu dot ac dot kr) (i) a CV, (ii) the list of taken subjects during undergrads, and (iii) the description of the most relevant project you have participated. **I would recommend students who plan to pursue an MS/Ph.D. degree first joining as undergraduate interns.**

## Undergraduate interns
Undergraduate interns will participate in an ongoing research project and support data collection, analysis, and model implementation. You could also join a study group of deep learning basics or recent technologies (e.g., Transformer, GPT-3, and CLIP) according to your interests and previous knowledge. If you are interested, please email me (kunwoo dot park at ssu dot ac dot kr) with a brief introduction.
